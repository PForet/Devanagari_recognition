This project is intended to be my capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree (https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009).
The dataset used was published by Ashok Kumar on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ashokpant/devanagari-character-dataset).

Goal : Given a hand written set of characters, the algorithm should be able to assign each character to its class. The performance on this task can be measured in term of accuracy (how many characters were correctly classified), and should be applicable to different writers.
